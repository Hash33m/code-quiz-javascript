# Description

The Code Quiz is a web-based quiz game that tests your knowledge of JavaScript. The quiz is timed, and you have to answer a series of multiple-choice questions before time runs out. The quiz is designed to help you practice your JavaScript skills and reinforce your understanding of the language.

## Getting Started
To get started with the JavaScript Code Quiz, open the quiz in your web browser. The quiz is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
When you start the quiz, you will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions. Each question has four possible answers, and you have to select the correct one. You have a limited amount of time to answer each question, so you need to be quick.

If you answer a question correctly, you will move on to the next one. If you answer a question incorrectly, you will lose time and have to answer another question to move on. The game ends when you answer all the questions or when time runs out.

At the end of the quiz, you will receive a score based on how many questions you answered correctly and how much time you had left. You can then compare your score with others who have taken the quiz.

## Features
The JavaScript Code Quiz includes several features that make it fun and challenging to play. 
Multiple-choice questions with four possible answers
A timer that counts down the remaining time
A score that is based on the number of correct answers and the time remaining
An option to save your high score
